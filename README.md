# MMO-Engine
Passion project to make a multiplayer game engine to build my game on, mostly serving as a dev kit for the game rather than a general-purpose engine.

The purpose of the project is to learn C++ as well as dive into some OpenGL stuff and learn to use their libraries.

# Current Goals (Top 3 things I'm currently working towards achieving on this project for the week):
- Render something on the window.
- Move the rendered thing in the window.
- Render a specific model on the window.
  
# So far achieved:
- Learning how to import libraries to the project with CMake.
- Compiling a working executable.
- Creating a blank window.
